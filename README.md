# Blindsight\_DFC\_GEC

## Overview

**Blindsight\_DFC\_GEC** provides a Python-based analysis pipeline for exploring dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and generative effective connectivity (GEC) in resting-state fMRI data from blindsight patients. The repository comprises Jupyter Notebooks that process and visualize the output of MATLAB scripts derived from Gustavo Deco’s lab work.
